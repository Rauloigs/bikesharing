# NYC Citi Bike Sharing

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The porpose of this new work is to convince the investors that the bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a profitable business idea. One of the key stakeholders wants to see a bike trip analysis.

To be able to provide this investor with the information required and in an easy visible way we are going to create 7 visualizations of the data, where 5 of them are new and 2 of them will be retrieved from the module of this week. The goal is to cover the following: 

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

The topics above should be cover in detail in **Results** so keep reading. 


## Results:

Here I´ll present (in the same order) 5 new visualization and 2 visualizations from the module that will help to convince the investor. 

### 1. Checkout Times for users

In the viz we can realize we are seeing at the first 3 hours of the day (0h, 01h, 02h). We can observe 2 important things, that the number of bikes increase while the hours of the day pass by (towards the first hours of the day) and that most of the trips within those two first hours have the tendency to be 1 hour trips. 

### 2. Checkout Times by Gender 

<img width="864" alt="Checkout_Times_Gender" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84519822/161401386-3d9d00f2-ea4b-462f-b538-f1c7b004848e.png">

At the first glance we realize we are looking at the same variables as the graphics before, but the difference remains on a new variable: the gender. So now we know the behavior of the genders across the hours and the number of bikes. Males have a higher usage of the bikes than women, but both tend to have the same direction graphically. 

### 3. Trips by Weekday per Hour

<img width="500" alt="Trips_Weekday_hour" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84519822/161401485-c77369c7-6a52-447a-9d72-dbb476c750e5.png">


This Worksheet provide us with important information of when the users increase the use of the bikes. From Monday to Friday the use of bikes increase in two moments across the day: 6 AM - 9 AM and 4 PM to 7 PM. On the other hand Saturday and Sunday it starts from 9 AM to 7 PM approximately. 

### 4. Trips by Gender

<img width="805" alt="Trips_byGender" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84519822/161401655-eb07310a-f28e-4cf6-8fb1-72d4c20427c0.png">


In this visualization we see what we´ve seen in past visual representations, which is that men use more often the bikes and the behavior during the hours of the day remain like in Trips by Weekday per Hour. So the behavior remains the same but proportional to the gender. 

### 5. User Trips by Gender by Week

<img width="358" alt="Trips_Gender_Weekday" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84519822/161401650-07b3656e-1fde-4429-974b-cc24264aae4d.png">

The extra in comparisson with the past 2 graphics is that here we can see the behavior of the suscriber. So this additional tells us that *Suscriber* type of user is more engaged with bike tripping than the *Customer*. This could be positive in the way that we need to incentivate users to become *Suscribers* because more suscriptions, more money for a long term. But it could be negative depending on the price set, because probably being a *Customer* generates more money to the company. But we will talk about this in the **Summary** of this report. 

### 6. Gender Distribution

<img width="126" alt="Captura de Pantalla 2022-04-02 a la(s) 15 31 42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84519822/161401913-1c3c89ed-928c-4a19-b791-a5685f8ed5fd.png">
<img width="175" alt="Gender_Filter" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84519822/161401817-38e05989-ea7e-4544-b1f5-6bccda5c6c94.png">

This Pie Chart can also help to complement the info in the first stories, because now we know from those men, from those women how many are involved. 

### Number of trips

<img width="112" alt="Number_Trips" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84519822/161401952-bdf83a1c-fec9-4357-a35c-36ac59c6cd53.png">

So, how many trips where there in August?



## Summary:

I would suggest to additional visualiztions: 

1. **Suscribers vs Customers Revenue**: How much revenue does each type of users represents within a month. 
2.
